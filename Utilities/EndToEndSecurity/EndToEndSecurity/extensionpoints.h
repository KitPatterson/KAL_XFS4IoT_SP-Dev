/// The firmware must create and track one nonce for use in command tokens. 
/// Note that there is no special handling needed for the responce token nonce - that's handled
/// by the host. 
/// The current nonce does not need to be tracked across power-cycles. A power cycle should clear 
/// the current nonce. However, the new nonce after the powercycle must be different to the previous 
/// values. 
/// Must return a pointer to a null terminated string containing a new nonce value. 
/// The nonce must be different to any proceeding nonce values, including across power-cycles. 
/// This could be done by persistently tracking an integer value and incrementing it. 
/// Alternatively it can be done by creating a long random number, using a hardware 
/// random number generator. 
/// The returned nonce pointer should remain valid for as long as the nonce is valid - 
/// i.e. until the nonce is cleared (or the machine is restarted.)
