        /// The encryption module must be initialized before any encryption function can be used.Every call to [KeyManagement.Initialization](#keymanagement.initialization) destroys all application keys that have been loaded or imported; it does not affect those keys loaded during manufacturing.Usually this command is called by an operator task and not by the application program.Public keys imported under the RSA Signature based remote key loading scheme when public key deletion authentication is required will not be affected. However, if this command is requested in authenticated mode, public keys that require authentication for deletion will be deleted. This includes public keys imported under either the RSA Signature based remote key loading scheme or the TR34 RSA Certificate based remote key loading scheme. Initialization also involves loading 'initial' application keys and local vendor dependent keys. These can be supplied, for example, by an operator through a keyboard, a local configuration file, remote RSA key management or possibly by means of some secure hardware that can be attached to the device. The application 'initial' keys would normally get updated by the application during a [KeyManagement.ImportKey](#keymanagement.importkey) command as soon as possible. Local vendor dependent static keys (e.g. storage, firmware and offset keys) would normally be transparent to the application and by definition cannot be dynamically changed.Where initial keys are not available immediately when this command is issued (i.e. when operator intervention is required), the Service Provider returns accessDenied and the application must await the [KeyManagement.InitializedEvent](#keymanagement.initializedevent).During initialization an optional encrypted ID key can be stored in the HW module. The ID key and the corresponding encryption key can be passed as parameters; if not, they are generated automatically by the encryption module.The encrypted ID is returned to the application and serves as authorization for the key import function.The [Capabilities](#common.capabilities.completion.properties.keymanagement) command indicates whether or not the device will support this feature. This function also resets the hsm terminal data, except session key index and trace number. This function resets all certificate data and authentication public/private keys back to their initial states at the time of production (except for those public keys imported under the RSA Signature based remote key loading scheme when public key deletion authentication is required). Key-pairs created with [KeyManagement.GenerateRSAKeyPair](#keymanagement.generatersakeypair) are deleted.Any keys installed during production, which have been permanently replaced, will not be reset.Any Verification certificates that may have been loaded must be reloaded.The Certificate state will remain the same, but the [KeyManagement.LoadCertificate](#keymanagement.loadcertificate) or [KeyManagement.ReplaceCertificate](#keymanagement.replacecertificate) commands must be called again.When multiple ZKA HSMs are present, this command deletes all keys loaded within all ZKA logical HSMs.\
